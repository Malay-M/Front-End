        <p >In this article,
            Iâ€™d like to 
            reacquaint you with the humble 
            workhorse of communication that 
            is the paragraph. Paragraphs are
             everywhere. In fact, at the high
              risk of stating the obvious, you
               are reading one now. Despite 
               their ubiquity, we frequently 
               neglect their presentation. 
               This is a mistake.
            </p>
